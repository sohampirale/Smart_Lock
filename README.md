# Smart_Lock
This is a program devloped for privacy maintainance using advanced methods like Salting and Hashing of passwords<br>
Pre-existing algorithms such as PBKDF2 and SHA-256 are used for hashing only.<br> 
Note : Make sure <openssl/evp.h> header file is installed for using Hasing algorithm
<br><br><br>
Open "With_Salting.c" to use salting algorithm only
<br>Open "With_Saltin_Hashing.c" to use salting and hashing algorithm<br>
Open "Hasing_Demo.c" to see how the hashed password actually looks like<br>
